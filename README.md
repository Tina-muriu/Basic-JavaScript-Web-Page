## Features

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML file defines the basic structure of the web page and includes a simple `<p>` element to display text content.

- **Styling with CSS**: The page is styled using CSS to set the text color to aqua and the background color to black. The `<p>` element is given a red border and is transformed to appear at a specific position on the page.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: The JavaScript code dynamically modifies the content. It demonstrates conditional statements (if-else) and object creation. Based on the age of a "Person," the code assigns a seniority level, and this information is logged to the console.
